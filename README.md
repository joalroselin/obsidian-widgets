# Quick Note Widget for Obsidian
A simple, lightweight Android widget for creating a new note in a **specific Obsidian vault** with a single tap.
When you first add the widget, a configuration screen will pop up, allowing you to enter the **exact name of your vault**. This makes it the fastest way to capture a thought into a specific vault without having to find the app, open it, switch vaults, and tap the "new note" button.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Problem:** When I tap the widget, Obsidian opens to a **blank screen** or the wrong vault.

**Cause:** The vault name you entered during configuration is incorrect (a typo, wrong case, or a missing space).

**Solution:** You must **remove** the widget from your home screen and **add it again**. This will restart the configuration process, allowing you to re-enter the correct name.
